Review 1:
I stayed in the Deluxe Executive Room and it was amazing: spacious with large 
workspace. The rooftop was beautiful for evening relaxation, and having DSTV in the 
room made winding down so easy. Highly recommend!
Review 2:
Great location, very convenient for travelers. I loved the standard room. It was simple, 
comfortable, budget-friendly, and with a very clean bathroom.
Review 3:
The hotel has everything you need: comfortable rooms, a well-lit conference room, and 
safe parking. I also appreciated the laundry service and the restaurant’s tasty meals. 
Definitely my go-to place when traveling north.
Review 4:
The hotel is in a quiet area, which made sleeping easy. Staff were very friendly and made 
small gestures, like offering directions and helping with luggage, which made a big 
difference.
Review 5:
I organized a small workshop at Baraka Hotel, and the experience was flawless. The 
conference room was perfect for our group of 45—air-conditioned, spacious, and welllit. Staff handled the setup efficiently and ensured refreshments were ready on time. 
Between sessions, we spent a little time on the rooftop, which provided a peaceful break 
with nice views.
